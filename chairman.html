            <div style="font-size: medium; margin-top: 2%;">
                <p>The year 2023-24 marked a significant milestone for our Company, as the number of shareholders grew
                    from just two to several lakhs. The recent IPO of 7.5 crore shares was a resounding success, being
                    oversubscribed about 30 times. This remarkable achievement reflects the strong vote of confidence in
                    our Company and is a humbling experience for us all. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our
                    investors for placing their faith in us. As we look ahead, we are committed to driving
                    transformational growth and serving our customers and stakeholders with unwavering dedication.</p>

                <p>India's economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid global uncertainties, maintaining robust
                    performance driven by strong government investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, supply chain,
                    logistics, and other sectors. The structural policy framework sets the stage for sustainable,
                    long-term growth, while the Central Bank’s proactive approach to addressing global shocks and
                    inflationary pressures continues to support the nation’s economic progress.</p>

                <p>The telecom industry stands as the backbone of India’s digital economy and a key catalyst for overall
                    growth. This sector plays a pivotal role in expanding connectivity and offering value-added services
                    that empower businesses to thrive. FY 2023-24 was a notable year for the telecom industry, marked by
                    a rapid 5G rollout across the country. 5G technology is set to create new capabilities and unlock
                    business opportunities across various sectors, including education, healthcare, transportation,
                    gaming, and financial services. In areas with low fixed-line penetration, 5G can foster growth by
                    meeting high data demand through fixed wireless access (FWA) offerings. The Government’s supportive
                    stance towards the sector, including the introduction of the new Telecommunications Act, will
                    further promote investment and orderly growth.</p>

                <p>The telecom circles of Rajasthan and the Northeast, where our Company operates, present long-term
                    growth opportunities. Although these regions are not densely populated, their potential for
                    expanding digital services contributes significantly to the national economy. Both mobile and
                    fixed-line data penetration in these areas is below the national average, highlighting substantial
                    growth potential for the telecom industry. The Government’s emphasis on enhancing connectivity and
                    infrastructure in these regions opens doors to promising opportunities.</p>

                <p>Over the years, Bharti Hexacom has made significant investments in these regions to enhance
                    connectivity and support economic growth. In FY 2023-24, we invested about ₹20 billion in the
                    business—one of the highest investments in the Company’s history—facilitating the rapid deployment
                    of 5G services and extending our coverage in rural areas. The Company added 2.5 million 4G/5G
                    customers, with data customers now representing 72.3% of the total base, compared to 55.6% three
                    years ago. Over the last three years, we have expanded home broadband offerings from 23 cities in FY
                    2020-21 to 93 cities through innovative partnerships with local cable operators. Our simple strategy
                    of attracting quality customers by providing exceptional experiences has solidified our leadership
                    in the Northeast and consistently narrowed the gap in Rajasthan, culminating in lifetime-high
                    revenue market share in both markets by the end of FY 2023-24.</p>

                <p>Superior revenue growth, combined with organic operating leverage and a focus on cost efficiencies,
                    has driven strong EBITDA growth over the years. Our ability to generate operating free cash and
                    prudent capital allocation have supported sustained deleveraging. Net debt to EBITDA for FY 2023-24
                    stood at 2.2x, compared to 2.8x in FY 2022-23. With no spectrum renewal obligations until FY 2029-30
                    and limited dues from recent spectrum auction installments, the Company is on track to strengthen
                    its balance sheet further.</p>

                <p>Looking ahead, we remain committed to our clear and simple strategy of offering a range of
                    high-quality telecom services and delivering the best consumer experience under the Airtel brand to
                    our growing customer base. This vision is made possible by our excellent leadership and management
                    team, composed of dedicated professionals with technical expertise. We are excited about the
                    opportunities that lie ahead and, with the Indian telecom sector entering a phase of increased
                    profitability, we are optimistic about our Company’s potential for many years of achievement,
                    growth, and success.</p>

                <p>Bharti Hexacom remains deeply conscious of its responsibility to the environment and society at
                    large. Beyond our immediate business priorities, we are taking concrete steps to reduce our
                    environmental footprint and are committed to energy conservation and technology absorption
                    initiatives. Additionally, we uphold our commitment to transparency, effective governance, fostering
                    a diverse and inclusive workplace, and maintaining high health and safety standards.</p>

                <p>We owe our success in FY 2023-24 to the efforts of our Board of Directors, management team, and
                    employees. I would also like to thank our customers, suppliers, agents, partners, and shareholders
                    for their support and contributions. I extend my gratitude to the outgoing directors—Shri Sanjeev
                    Kumar, Shri Surajit Mandol, Mr. Rahul Vatts, Mr. Ravinder Arora, and Ms. Vidyut Gulati—for their
                    service to the Company. We warmly welcome our new Independent Directors, Mr. Ashok Tyagi, Mr. Arvind
                    Kohli, Mr. Arun Gupta, Mr. Kapal Kumar Vohra, and Ms. Nalina Suresh, to the Board.</p>
